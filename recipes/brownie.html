        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <p>I recently found myself in need of a good brownie recipe. You’d think that wouldn’t be an issue for someone who works at Allrecipes, but I wanted something specific. I needed it to be quick and easy. Then I remembered something I hadn’t thought of since childhood: my Great Aunt Judy’s brownies.</p>
        <p>Aunt Judy was just about the sweetest lady who ever lived (I know people often say that about their late relatives, but it’s true in this case). She always made sure to have my favorite dessert ready whenever I came over—and, as it turns out, it really wasn’t that much of an undertaking. You see, Aunt Judy had a secret ingredient that came from the candy aisle.</p>
   
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (18-ounce) box brownie mix (such as Ghirardelli)</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1-2 (7.37-ounce) Giant Symphony bars or 2-3 (4.25-ounce) XL Symphony bars, broken into squares</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and grease an 8x8-inch pan. </li>
            <li>Combine the mix, water, oil, and egg in a bowl and stir until fully incorporated. </li>
            <li>Pour half of the batter into the pan, then arrange the Symphony squares in an even layer across the batter. Pour the remaining batter into the pan.</li>
            <i>Bake the brownies for 40-45 minutes.</i>
        </ol>
